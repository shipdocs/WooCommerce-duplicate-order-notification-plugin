## üîç Potential Issues to Address

### Minor Issues:

1. **No Settings Page**
   - Currently no admin settings
   - Consider adding:
     - Configurable time period (currently hard-coded to 3 months)
     - Ability to enable/disable for specific user roles
     - Custom messages
     - Status selection (which order statuses to check)

2. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - No unit tests included
   - Consider adding PHPUnit tests for core functionality

3. **No Admin Interface**
   - Could benefit from a dashboard widget showing duplicate detection stats
   - Settings page for configuration options

### Enhancement Opportunities:

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Could notify admins of attempted duplicate orders
   - Could send emails to customers

2. **Reporting**
   - Dashboard with duplicate detection statistics
   - Export functionality

3. **Advanced Rules**
   - Allow/deny lists for specific products
   - Different rules for different product categories
   - Time-based rules

4. **Performance**
